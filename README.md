# Calculator

I am excited to present my web application of a basic calculator, built from scratch. This project was part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s Foundations section, and through it I was able to greatly improve my CSS and Javascript skills, consolidating my knowledge of Front-End development.

In addition to mastering CSS and Javascript, I also learned to work with Flexbox and Grid layouts to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

This calculator project was a fantastic opportunity to work with event listeners, handling user input and performing mathematical operations. 

## Features

- Perform basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Combine multiple operations in a single line
- Calculate roots and powers
- Delete individual digits with the delete button
- Clear the display with AC
- Entirely custom CSS design

## Live Demo

Check out a live demo of the calculator [here](https://fer5899.github.io/calculator/).

## Conclusion

Overall, this project allowed me to further my understanding of Front-End development and I am happy with the end result. The calculator has a clean and appealing design, and it functions exactly as expected. Simple, but effective.
